# Identify_Customers_Segments
* This is an unsupervised learning project in Udacity Data Science Nanomaster which brings Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions whose two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company are provided . The objective is to look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained. 

## Required libries
JupyterNotebook Numpy Pandas Matplotlib Seaborn Sklearn / scikit-learn

## Progress
* ```Preprocessing:``` preprocess the data which includes identifying missing or unknown values encoded in the data and checking if certain features (columns) that should be removed from the analysis because of missing data. 

* ```Feature transformation``` including using dimensionality reduction techniques to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. 

* ```clustering``` using the k-means method to cluster the demographic data and customers data into groups.

* ```comparing``` comparing the clustered results of those two dataset to see which label are significantly different.

## Result
* using matplotlib created a visual comparison representation of customer data vs demographic data and concluded which segments/clusters of customers can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
